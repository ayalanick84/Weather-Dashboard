# Weather-Dashboard
For this project, I created a Weather Dashboard using the openweather api. 
When the user inputs the name of a city, they are presented with the temperature, humidity , UV Index and
wind speed of the the current. As well as a simplified 5 day forecast. The user will also be able to see their search history pop up as buttons on the side of the screen.

Although the application did not turn out to be as personalized as I wanted to make it, I feel that I recreated the demo to the best of my ability.
